# RobaleProject

RobaleProject is our university project. The idea of it is pretty simple, we all
would like to learn more about machine learning and apply it in some way.

## Objective:
As an objective of this project we chose to create a board game that one of us 
created in their spar time. After implementing mechanics of the game we will try
to learn AI to play this game. Our goal is rather to learn more about this 
amazing field of science then to succeed and create program with most optimal
strategy to play this game.
